## Slide Deck Breakdown
1. **Title Slide**  
   - “Software Code & Threat Analysis Presentation” – Introduction and objectives.

2. **Flawfinder**  
   - Overview of Flawfinder, a tool for scanning C/C++ source code for potential security flaws (CWE-compatible).

3. **ImageMagick v.7.1.0-27**  
   - Introduction to ImageMagick, its version history (October 2021 release), and how it can introduce potential threats when handling untrusted image inputs.

4. **Detail/Discover SW Threats**  
   - General guidance on how to identify weaknesses in the software supply chain and dependencies.

5. **Discuss Mitigations – CVE-2022-28463**  
   - Explanation of CVE-2022-28463, its impact, and recommended patching or workaround steps.

6. **FFmpeg v.4.4.3**  
   - Overview of FFmpeg 4.4.3 (released August 26, 2021), typical use cases, and potential vulnerabilities in multimedia processing.

7. **Detail/Discover SW Threats**  
   - How to spot unsafe library usage or untrusted media streams when using FFmpeg.

8. **Discuss Mitigations**  
   - Best practices for safely configuring FFmpeg, updating to secure versions, and sandboxing multimedia operations.

9. **OWASP Dependency-Check**  
   - Introduction to OWASP Dependency-Check, a software composition analysis (SCA) tool for scanning third-party libraries (Java, .NET, Ruby, Python, Node.js) against known CVE databases.

10. **Apache Struts v.2.2.3.1**  
    - Historical context on Apache Struts 2.2.3.1 (released 2011), common exploitation vectors, and infamous security incidents tied to Struts.

11. **Detail/Discover SW Threats**  
    - Steps to audit Struts-based applications, identify outdated or vulnerable Struts components, and assess risk.

12. **Discuss Mitigations**  
    - Guidance on upgrading to a secure version of Struts, applying vendor patches, and implementing runtime protections (e.g., WAF rules).

13. **OpenSSL v.1.0.1**  
    - Overview of OpenSSL 1.0.1 (released 2012), notable vulnerabilities (e.g., Heartbleed), and how cryptographic libraries can introduce critical risks if not properly maintained.

14. **Detail/Discover SW Threats**  
    - Techniques for finding insecure usage of OpenSSL APIs, weak ciphers, or out-of-date libraries in existing codebases.

15. **Discuss Mitigations**  
    - Best practices for updating OpenSSL, enforcing strong ciphers, and performing routine cryptographic audits.
